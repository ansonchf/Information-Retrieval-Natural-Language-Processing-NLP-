Incredibly powerful to hear first-hand accounts from key workers on the front line today. They are the best of our country and the Government must do all it can to protect them.
Thank you to everyone who observed a minute‚Äôs silence to remember our transport workers who lost their lives to coronavirus.
Every week as millions of us stand on our doorsteps to clap our carers and key workers it is an emotional moment of profound thanks to those who are keeping our country going, putting their health and lives at risk for others. #ClapForOurCarers
Tonight we go out to clap for our carers and key workers - those who are putting their lives at risk to keep us safe. When this pandemic is over, we can‚Äôt go back to business as usual with people left underpaid and undervalued. We owe them more than that.
I fully support the Government‚Äôs decision to extend the lockdown. The priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp up in testing, that staff get the PPE they desperately need and more is done to protect our care homes from the virus.
We also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right.
Join us tomorrow at 11am in a minute's silence for our London bus driver colleagues lost to #COVID19
Looking forward to working with you all!
Incredible. Thank you for all you‚Äôve done for our country, @captaintommoore and thank you to all who have donated.
The pressures facing our councils during the coronavirus are immense.  The Government must do more to listen to them and ensure they get the support they need.
I've just hosted a call with over 100 local government leaders to discuss the front line response to coronavirus and listening to the challenges they‚Äôre facing. They need more PPE, they need more testing and they need sight of the Government‚Äôs exit strategy.
Today we remember the 96 who lost their lives 31 years ago, as well as the bravery, dignity and resilience of the Hillsborough families in their fight for justice. You‚Äôll never walk alone.
I urge the government to publish their exit strategy. Millions of people are playing their part. In return, the government needs to be open and transparent with the public about how it believes the lockdown will ease and eventually end. My letter to @DominicRaab
I was pleased to meet with business leaders from. Very constructive discussions about defeating the coronavirus & ensuring a strong economic recovery. I look forward to working together with them on this.
I would like to wish Tamil and Sinhala communities a very happy new year. I also want to extend my thanks to all of you who are on the front line in the fight against coronavirus, whether in the NHS or a key worker, you are serving our country and are the very best of us.
Care homes are on the front line of this crisis. The Government should include those who sadly die in care homes in their daily reporting numbers and ensure that all care staff have the protective equipment they need.
The faces of those who gave their lives to keep us safe. The Government must provide our frontline staff with the equipment they desperately need.
Happy Vaisakhi to all those celebrating. I‚Äôve seen first-hand the vital work that gurdwaras and other Sikh organisations across the country are doing in their communities at this difficult time. Thank you.
There are countless other organisations doing incredible work in difficult circumstances. The government funding announced for charities this week is a welcome first step but more is needed to ensure they don‚Äôt have to close their doors at this vital time. Follow @ncvo for info.
If you‚Äôre able to donate, there are many charities that need our support, such as @CPAGUK. Local initiatives like @camdengiving (who‚Äôve raised over ¬£163k for local projects) really do make a huge difference. To all CVS organisations and communities, thank you!
If you suffer from lung disease (e.g. COPD) or asthma, @lunguk and @asthmauk are creating some really useful advice: http://blf.org.uk/support-for-you/coronavirus
@UKScouting has created hundreds of free activities to make sure children continue to develop skills and stay active at home called #TheGreatIndoors.
@HealingJusticeLDN has created mental and physical health support for marginalised communities. http://healingjusticeldn.org
At this difficult time charities across the UK have gone above and beyond to assist, support and offer comfort to communities during #Covid19. I‚Äôd like to thank them for their efforts and share some examples of those I have spoken to recently. [Thread]
@actnforchildren are supporting some of the most vulnerable during this crisis, and have developed advice and guidance for families including 1-1 support from experienced parenting coaches.
During the lockdown, it‚Äôs so important to keep mentally and physically healthy. To combat loneliness @TheCaresFamily has released an #AloneTogether activity pack created by young people to help older neighbours stay connected.
Heartbreaking that we have now had more than 10,000 coronavirus deaths in the UK. We must remember the people behind the numbers. Every one is a tragedy, every one is a family shattered. #StayHomeSaveLives
It‚Äôs a scandal our Government has failed to ensure there‚Äôs enough PPE reaching frontline health and social care workers, let alone other key workers responding to #COVID19. We must now work with international partners to overcome these challenges.
I understand that the Government‚Äôs trying to rise to the challenge, but we‚Äôve seen a real issue about protective equipment with the Government saying one thing and the frontline saying another. There must be proper, Parliamentary scrutiny of the decisions being made. #Ridge
Happy Easter to all celebrating. It will be very different this year with churches closed, families separated and people anxious about the future. We will get through this, and when we do so, we must do it with a vision of a changed and a better society.
At this time of national emergency, we need a functioning Parliament to hold ministers to account on their response to the coronavirus.  There are too many questions that have gone unanswered. There is no substitute for scrutiny.
It is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. There are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe.  The Government must act to ensure supplies are delivered.
Today, I wrote to @MattHancock urging him to publish daily figures of deaths outside hospitals, incl in care homes. This is essential to understanding the true scale of problem and ensuring all care workers get the PPE & tests we need to save lives
The Government is right to urge everyone to stay at home, but if they are to keep the public‚Äôs trust we need to see more transparency.  That‚Äôs why I have urged the Government to publish its exit strategy so people know how this lockdown will end.
Thank you to our frontline police officers who are working to keep the public safe in the most difficult of circumstances through the #coronavirus:
When we get through this ‚Äì and we will get through this ‚Äì it will be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters. They are the best of us.
Another fantastic tribute to our NHS staff and care workers. Thank you. #ClapForCarers
This is good news. I hope it is the beginnings of a speedy recovery.
I‚Äôm calling on the Government to publish its exit strategy. I‚Äôm not calling for precise timings, but the strategy. This is incredibly difficult on people and we need to know that plans are in place, and what they are.
20 years today since the death of my predecessor in Parliament and all-round Tottenham legend Bernie Grant. He was a pioneering campaigner for social justice and equality. His legacy will never be forgotten ‚úäüèø
Thank you for such a warm and welcoming conversation earlier today. Mosques across the country have taken a leading role in their communities at such a difficult time by facilitating support for those in need and by supporting social distancing measures. Thank you.
Thank you for your time this morning. The church has shown real leadership and compassion by following social distancing guidelines and closing its churches. This is a difficult decision that I know has not been taken lightly but it will save lives - thank you.
As you prepare to celebrate the festival of Passover, I send my warmest wishes to the Jewish community. May this Passover bring hope at a time of darkness and may it not be long before we have the opportunity to celebrate together once more. Chag Sameach.
Domestic abuse services are under extraordinary pressure in this crisis. In the sprit of providing responsible opposition, I‚Äôve written to the Home Secretary on the need for urgent action to support the sector, offering to do what we can to help:
To all our key workers and to everyone doing their bit ‚Äì thank you. #StayHomeSaveLives
Today we met with our new Labour leader and deputy leader, @Keir_Starmer and @AngelaRayner, to discuss the issues that matter to our members and working together to rid our Party of antisemitism.
I will leave no stone left unturned in the fight against antisemitism. That is my promise to the Jewish community. My piece for @StandardNews and @jewishchron.
All of our thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family at this difficult time. This is a national crisis and the Labour Party will act in the national interest, working constructively with the government.

I want to continue to work with @RishiSunak to make sure that the schemes that have been put in place are delivering the support that is necessary. There are still a lot of people currently who are falling through the gaps so we need to plug them.
We will unite and we will work for the interests of the Scottish people, their public services, their well-being and their prosperity.My piece in the @Daily_Record
Wishing the Prime Minister well and a speedy recovery.

I want to see the government succeed in defeating the coronavirus, to save lives and protect livelihoods. This is a national effort and all of us should be asking what more we can do.
It‚Äôs the honour and privilege of my life to be elected as Leader of the Labour Party. I will lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and hope, so that when the time comes, we can serve our country again ‚Äì in government.
